# NumberGuessingGame
Build a console-based Java application where:  The computer randomly selects a number within a certain range (e.g., 1 to 100).  The user is prompted to guess the number.  The program provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.  Count the number of attempts and display the total once the user guesses correctly.
